Today, we will cover several different software tools that are used for studying membranes and filaments in cryo-ET. If you are interested in studying these or other aspects of cellular ultrastructure, please reach out to me and I will be happy to help you find the right tools for your specific project, or to collaborate to develop new tools if needed - I am always looking for new projects!</p> <p>The three major tools we will cover today are:</p> <ul> <li>Membrain-Seg - a deep learning-based tool for segmenting membranes in cryo-ET data. This tool is nearly bulletproof for segmenting membranes, and does not require retraining. It is developed by Lorenz Lamm as part a collaboration between Ben Engel and Tingying Ping's research groups, and is part of the teamtomo community software development effort led loosely by Alister Burt.</li> <li>Dragonfly - a commercial software package that is widely used in the cryo-ET community for segmentation and modeling. Matt Swulius has developed a number of workflows for Dragonfly that are used for segmentation and modeling of cellular features. Dragonfly is especially nice for its user-friendly interface for generating training data and training and evaluating models for segmentation. This makes it great for studying your filament of choice, since it is flexible and does not rely on pretrained models.</li> <li>Surface Morphometrics - an open-source toolkit for building high quality triangle mesh models in a fully automated way from segmentations in Cryo-ET, and using those segmentations to quantify local and global membrane ultrastructure. This software was developed by me during my postdoc in Danielle Grotjahn's lab at Scripps Research, and my lab is continuing to develop new methodology within the framework. </li> </ul> <p>We'll also use the following tools for visualization and analysis:</p> <ul> <li>IMOD - a suite of tools for 3D reconstruction and modeling of tomographic data. We will use IMOD for visualization of tomograms and segmentations</li> <li>Meshlab - a powerful open-source tool for processing and editing 3D meshes. We will use Meshlab for manual generation of triangle meshes.</li> <li>Paraview - a powerful open-source tool for visualization and analysis of large datasets. We will use Paraview for visualization of quantifications on meshes.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"membrain-seg/","title":"Membrain-Seg","text":"<p>Membrain-Seg is a relatively new tool for segmenting membranes in cryo-ET data. It is based on a deep learning model that has been trained on a variety of cellular tomograms. The model is able to segment membranes with high accuracy with a pretrained model, which makes it pretty much bulletproof as a first step for starting the segmentation process. If you want to do morphometrics, you can pretty quickly move from the Membrain-Seg output to a mesh using the <code>segmentation_to_meshes.py</code> script in the <code>surface_morphometrics</code> package (though I recommend you extract the individual components into their own classes first using dragonfly or amira).</p>"},{"location":"membrain-seg/#setup","title":"Setup","text":"<pre><code>conda activate membrain-seg\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"membrain-seg/#running-membrain-seg","title":"Running Membrain-Seg","text":"<pre><code>membrain segment --tomogram-path TE3_tomo.mrc --ckpt-path /sw/membrain-seg/models/MemBrain_seg_v10_alpha_MONAI1.3.0.ckpt --store-probabilities\n3dmod &lt;path_to_predictions&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Usually, this is all you have to do.

You should now have a set of membrane segmentations that are ready to be turned into meshes for morphometrics! For today's exercises, we will use these segmentations to help with dragonfly, but we will use some precalculated segmentations for morphometrics.

It turns out to be useful for a whole lot more than mitochondria! You can use it to assess aspects of membrane geometry in detail both locally and globally within cells, thanks to a robust meshing (modeling) algorithm and a set of simple tools for making measurements on the resulting surfaces.</p> <p>Today we will scratch the surface with a single tomogram, but one of the most valuable aspects of building models and making quantifications is that it becomes possible to assess statistical significance by comparing quantifications across many tomograms in different cells and conditions. This is a powerful way to move from qualitative phenomenology about cellular remodeling to robust quantitative understanding of the underlying biology.
